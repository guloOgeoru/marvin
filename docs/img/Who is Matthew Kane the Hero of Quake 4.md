In this article, we will explore the background, personality and achievements of Matthew Kane, the hero of Quake 4.
 
## Background
 
Nothing is known about Matthew Kane's early life before the events of Quake 4, but it seems likely that he received a typical Lunar upbringing in the years before the Strogg invaded Earth. At some point around or following the outbreak of war, Kane enlisted in the forces of the Global Defense Force, subsequently transferring into the Terran Coalition of Man's Space Marine Corps around the time of its formation, wherein he would attain the rank of Corporal[^1^].
 
Above all else, Cpl. Matthew Kane is a survivor. He was aboard Space Station Armstrong when the Strogg launched an overwhelming attack on it, and he was the only person to emerge from it alive. He is the only one who knows exactly what took place there, and he is under the strictest orders to remain silent on the matter. After several months of recuperation, Kane was assigned to Rhino Squad, where he serves in the second retaliatory attack on Stroggos[^1^].
 
## Personality
 
Kane never speaks during the game, but he most likely narrated the Quake 4 trailer with these words about the Strogg:

> I hear their voices when I sleep. I've seen the worst of war. But I can't escape the images of the Strogg. A metallic spine, jutting awkwardly through muscle. Flesh and bone fused with wires and steel. I hear their voices when I sleep. Created for war, and fueled by the blood of their enemy. But this isn't just a nightmare, it's who I've become.

These words suggest that Kane is haunted by his experiences with the Strogg, and that he feels a sense of alienation from his humanity after being partially transformed into one of them. He also shows a strong sense of duty and courage, as he continues to fight against overwhelming odds and completes his mission despite his personal trauma.
 
## Achievements
 
Kane's achievements are numerous and impressive throughout Quake 4. He participates in several key battles against the Strogg forces, such as destroying their air defense grid, infiltrating their network hub tower, rescuing his squadmates from captivity, and escorting a convoy to deliver a bomb to disable their main communication device[^2^].
 
The most notable achievement of Kane is surviving the process of stroggification, which involves being captured by the Strogg and subjected to horrific experiments that replace his organs and limbs with mechanical parts. He is rescued by his squad before his mind is erased, and becomes one of the few humans who can use both human and Strogg weapons and technology[^1^]. This gives him an edge in combat and allows him to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible to humans.
 
Kane's final achievement is killing the new Makron, the leader of the Strogg who replaced the one killed by Bitterman in Quake 2. He confronts him in his palace and manages to destroy his massive mech suit and his organic body with his rail gun. He then proceeds to enter the Nexus Core, where he shuts down the Strogg's central nervous system and effectively ends their threat once and for all[^2^].
 
## Conclusion
 
Matthew Kane is a remarkable hero who overcomes incredible challenges and sacrifices in his quest to save humanity from the Strogg menace. He is a survivor, a warrior, and a legend among his peers. He is also a tragic figure who loses part of his identity and humanity in his transformation into a Strogg-human hybrid. He is one of the most memorable characters in Quake history.

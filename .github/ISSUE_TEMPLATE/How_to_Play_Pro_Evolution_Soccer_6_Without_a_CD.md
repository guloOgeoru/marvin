## What is a Crack?
 
A crack is a modified version of the game's executable file (pes6.exe) that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without inserting the disc. A crack can be downloaded from various websites that offer game fixes, such as GameBurnWorld[^1^], GameCopyWorld[^2^], or MegaGames[^3^]. However, be careful when downloading cracks, as some of them may contain viruses or malware. Always scan the files with an antivirus program before using them.
 
## How to Use a Crack?
 
To use a crack, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Install the game normally using the original CD.
2. Download the crack file from one of the websites mentioned above. Make sure it matches your game version and language.
3. Extract the crack file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
4. Copy the pes6.exe file from the crack folder and paste it into your game installation folder, usually located at C:\Program Files\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 6. Overwrite the existing file when prompted.
5. Run the game from the pes6.exe file or create a shortcut on your desktop. You don't need to insert the CD anymore.

## What is a Mini-Image?
 
A mini-image is a small file that contains only the essential data from the original CD that is needed to run the game. A mini-image can be mounted on a virtual drive using a program like DAEMON Tools or Alcohol 120%. This way, the game will think that you have inserted the CD, even though you are using a digital copy. A mini-image can be downloaded from websites like GameCopyWorld[^2^] or MegaGames[^4^].
 
## How to Use a Mini-Image?
 
To use a mini-image, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install the game normally using the original CD.
2. Download the mini-image file from one of the websites mentioned above. Make sure it matches your game version and language.
3. Extract the mini-image file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
4. Install and run a virtual drive program like DAEMON Tools or Alcohol 120%. Create a new virtual drive and assign it a letter.
5. Mount the poseden\_MINI\_pro6.mds file from the mini-image folder on your virtual drive using your virtual drive program.
6. Use an anti-blacklisting tool, like SecuROM Loader v1.2 / v7.26[^2^], to avoid blacklisting of your virtual drive program by the game's protection system.
7. Run the game from your virtual drive or create a shortcut on your desktop. You don't need to insert the CD anymore.
